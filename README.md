# WiTeX
*If Donald Knuth had designed Wikipedia*

Multicolumn edition.
## Install
If you have a Wikipedia account, open your [Preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences), go to the Appearance tab, and edit the Custom CSS for the Vector skin.
Paste [`style.css`](https://github.com/michaelko/WiTeX/raw/master/style.css) into the code editor, and save.

Alternatively, you can load the CSS using a browser plugin for the domain `https?://*.wikipedia.org`.

Currently this style loads the fonts from the servers of AndrewBelt. He's looking for a CDN, as he writes in the code.
#### I want the old Wikipedia design back!

There is no longer a link to the Preferences page on Wikipedia, so [here's the URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences).

Change the skin to something else, apply, and remove the Custom CSS from the Vector skin.
Or, you could manually go to this URL while logged in:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MyPage/vector.css&action=edit
